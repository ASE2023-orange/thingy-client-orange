# ThingyClientOrange

This project is part of the "Advanced Software Engineering" Master lecture at University of Fribourg. It features a simple angular client to consume thingyorange API ressources, a monitoring solution for distributed solar power plants.

## Quick starting guide for development

- Make sure to have node installed on your system. Install dependencies using :
```npm install```
- To run the application:
```ng serve --open```

## Production setup
Production setup is available on the api github readme page. After cloning the repository, and adapting and using the docker-compose file, the app should build and be served using nginx.

# Angular readme:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
